I redrew Philip Bump's diagram from his article "Nearly a quarter of Americans have never experienced the U.S. in a time of peace" as an exercise to practice d3.js.

Simply enter your birth year here & it will recalculate the diagram.`));


    $("#explain2").html(md.makeHtml(`Note that the "start" & "end" years reflect USA's involvement in the war, not the total length of each war.

And yes, I know that you're supposed to improve the diagram for [#makeovermonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/), but I'm just doing this as a warmup exercise. Maybe next week I'll change the diagram more.

 * Better labels, e.g. Years each war started
 * Hoverover for labels?
