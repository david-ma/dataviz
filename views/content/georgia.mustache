This helpful world map will show you which Georgia you are closest to.

Georgia the US State (32.1656° N, 82.9001° W) or Georgia the Country (42.3154° N, 43.3569° E)`

Core features being practiced in this exericse:
- geojson
- d3 map projection
- d3 drag and drop (for repositioning your pin)
- geoip database lookup, to get visitor’s location by IP address
- calculate distance (and take into account that the world is round and you might be closer to the other one if you go _left_ at the equator)
- mobile friendly layout
- deployment & quick redeployment

Feature requests:
- Extra Georgias (e.g. South Georgia island)
- What if you’re inside a Georgia? Get boundaries of each Georgia and check if you’re in one? Find closest distance to edge of a Georgia, to return as the result? Currently each location is just based on point coordinates, not a shape/geojson feature.

Stretch goal:
- Draw a better, more accurate pin
- animation of pin being picked up & moved
- different projections
- animation between projections
- Allow user comments/notes to be left? Or submit corrections if the wrong location is looked up?

Tests to write:
- Test that map builds?
- Test geoip lookup is accurate
- Test drag, dragging, drop?
- Test coordinates -> kilometres calculation See less
